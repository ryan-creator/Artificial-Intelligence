<h1> Evolve a species in a game </h1>

For this assignment, I had to implement a genetic algorithm to optimise the fitness of a
species of creatures in a 2D grid-based game. The game pits two populations of creatures
(red and blue) against each other – one population controlled by an agent I was tasked
with implementing. The objective is for the agent to eat strawberries, placed at random
on the grid, grow in size and eat opposing creatures of smaller size. The creatures grow in
size by eating strawberries or opponent’s creatures. My algorithm should find behaviours
that lead to more of your creatures (regardless of size) surviving at the end of the game.
The trick is that each creature acts as an independent agent and these behaviours must
be learned through the process of simulated fitness selection and evolution – i.e. a genetic
algorithm.
